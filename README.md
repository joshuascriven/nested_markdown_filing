# nested_markdown_filing
Use included python script to create a nested set of folders containing markdown files, patterned after the sections of an academic paper. Alternatively, use the default folder-file structure, also included.

Helpful for use with my [nested_md_to_PDF](https://github.com/joshuascriven/nested_md_to_PDF/tree/master) tool.
